# MultiStage-Production-Line-RSLogix-500

## Project Name:
Multi-Stage Production Line Automation using PLC

## Objective:
This program automates a product passing through four dependent stages:
1. Cleaning
2. Filling
3. Sealing
4. Packaging

Each stage is controlled by a dedicated timer, and the transition to the next stage only occurs when the
current one finishes. At the end of the full cycle, the process resets and repeats automatically until a STOP
command is given.
